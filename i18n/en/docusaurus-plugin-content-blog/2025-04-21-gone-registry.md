# Using Service Registration and Discovery

## Introduction

In the cloud-native era, Kubernetes has become the standard choice for container orchestration, with its built-in service discovery mechanism sufficient for many scenarios. However, in specific situations, such as when implementing client-side load balancing or more granular service governance, third-party service registration and discovery components (like Nacos, Consul, or Etcd) often provide more professional and flexible solutions. This article will explore how the Gone framework elegantly integrates these service governance components to make your microservice architecture more robust.

## Service Registration and Discovery: The Foundation of Microservice Architecture

In microservice architecture, service registration and discovery are like a city's traffic hub, solving the following key issues:

### Dynamic Communication and Flexible Governance

Imagine if there was no service registration center - every service address change would require manual configuration modification and application restart, which is almost impossible in an elastic cloud environment. Through a registration center:

- Service providers automatically register their metadata (address, port, etc.) to the center when starting
- Service consumers don't need hardcoded addresses, instead dynamically querying available instances
- New instances automatically join the service cluster, faulty instances are automatically removed

This mechanism makes service scaling and migration effortless, greatly enhancing system elasticity.

### Load Balancing and High Availability Assurance

Nothing is more troublesome than single point failures. Service registration and discovery ensure system high availability through the following mechanisms:

- Real-time health checks ensure requests are only routed to healthy nodes
- Traffic is evenly distributed through algorithms like round-robin, random, or weighted
- Special mechanisms like Nacos's weight strategy or Eureka's self-preservation mode enhance system stability

These mechanisms work together to keep your system running smoothly even when facing high concurrency and partial node failures.

### System Decoupling and Operations Simplification

One of the core principles of microservice architecture is "high cohesion, low coupling":

- Services communicate indirectly through the registration center, reducing direct dependencies
- Unified service governance platform simplifies complex operations like version updates and grayscale releases
- Supports multi-language, multi-protocol integration, improving system compatibility and extensibility

## Service Registration and Discovery in Practice with Gone Framework

Let's look at an example of how to quickly enable service registration and discovery functionality in the Gone framework. Assuming we're already using **goner/grpc** to provide gRPC services, taking Nacos as an example:

### 1. Install Dependencies

First, add the necessary package:

```bash
go get github.com/gone-io/goner/nacos
```

### 2. Load Service Registration and Discovery Component

Load the Nacos component at the application entry point:

```go
gone.
    //...other components
    Loads(nacos.RegistryLoad). // Load service registration and discovery component
    //...
```

### 3. Configure Server and Client

**Server Configuration (YAML)**:

```yaml
# nacos configuration
nacos:
  client:
    namespaceId: public
    asyncUpdateService: false
    logLevel: debug
    logDir: ./logs/
  server:
    ipAddr: "127.0.0.1"
    contextPath: /nacos
    port: 8848
    scheme: http

# grpc server configuration
server:
  grpc:
    port: 0 # Random listening port, perfect for dynamic deployment in cloud environments
    service-name: hello-svc # Service name, consumers will discover service through this name
    service-use-subnet: 0.0.0.0/0 # Subnet where service is accessible
```

**Client Configuration (YAML)**:

```yaml
# nacos configuration
nacos:
  client:
    namespaceId: public
    asyncUpdateService: false
    logLevel: debug
    logDir: ./logs/
  server:
    ipAddr: "127.0.0.1"
    contextPath: /nacos
    port: 8848
    scheme: http

# grpc client configuration
server:
  grpc:
    lb-policy: round_robin # Load balancing policy

grpc.service.hello-svc.address: hello-svc
```

**Client Code**:
```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"github.com/gone-io/gone/v2"
	gone_grpc "github.com/gone-io/goner/grpc"
	"github.com/gone-io/goner/nacos"
	"github.com/gone-io/goner/viper"
	"google.golang.org/grpc"
	"grpc_use_discovery/proto"
	"log"
	"time"
)

type helloClient struct {
	gone.Flag
	proto.HelloClient // Method 1: Embed HelloClient, this component only handles initialization, providing capabilities to third-party components


	// config=${configuration key},address=${service address}; //config has higher priority
	clientConn *grpc.ClientConn `gone:"*,config=grpc.service.hello-svc.address"`
}

func (c *helloClient) Init() {
	c.HelloClient = proto.NewHelloClient(c.clientConn)
}

func main() {
	gone.
		NewApp(
			gone_grpc.ClientRegisterLoad,
			viper.Load,
			nacos.RegistryLoad,
		).
		Load(&helloClient{}).
		Run(func(in struct {
			hello *helloClient `gone:"*"` // Inject helloClient in Run method's parameters
		}) {
			for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
				// Call Say method, send message to server
				say, err := in.hello.Say(context.Background(), &proto.SayRequest{Name: "gone"})
				if err != nil {
					log.Printf("err: %v", err)
					return
				}
				log.Printf("say result: %s", say.Message)
			}

			time.Sleep(time.Second * 10)
		})
}
```

That's it! With the above configuration, your service will automatically register with Nacos, and clients can automatically discover services and establish connections. For complete example code, refer to: [grpc_use_discovery](https://github.com/gone-io/goner/tree/main/examples/grpc_use_discovery)

## Implementation Principles Revealed

Gone framework's service registration and discovery mechanism consists of three core parts: server-side registration, client-side discovery, and load balancing. Let's unveil their mysteries:

### 1. Server-side Registration Mechanism

When the service starts, the `regService` method in `server.go` is responsible for registering service information to the registration center:

```go
func (s *server) regService() func() error {
    if s.registry != nil {
        service := g.NewService(s.serviceName, ip.String(), port, g.Metadata{"grpc": "true"}, true, 100)
        err := s.registry.Register(service)
        // ...error handling
    }
    return nil
}
```

This code accomplishes the following:
- Creates a service instance containing service name, IP, port, metadata, etc.
- Registers the service instance to the configured registration center (like Nacos)
- Sets health check and service weight parameters

When the service gracefully stops, it will automatically execute deregistration to remove the service instance from the registration center.

### 2. Client-side Service Discovery

Client-side service discovery is implemented through gRPC's resolver mechanism:

```go
type clientRegister struct {
    gone.Flag
    logger      gone.Logger        `gone:"*"`
    //...
    discovery   g.ServiceDiscovery `gone:"*" option:"allowNil"`
    rb          resolver.Builder

    //...
    loadBalancingPolicy string         `gone:"config,server.grpc.lb-policy=round_robin"`
    //...
}

func (s *clientRegister) Init() {
    if s.discovery != nil {
        s.rb = NewResolverBuilder(s.discovery, s.logger)
    }
}

func (s *clientRegister) createConn(address string) (conn *grpc.ClientConn, err error) {
    if s.rb != nil {
        options = append(options,
            grpc.WithResolvers(s.rb),
            grpc.WithDefaultServiceConfig(fmt.Sprintf(`{"loadBalancingPolicy":"%s"}`, s.loadBalancingPolicy)),
        )
    }
    // ...establish connection
}
```

This design achieves:
- Automatic resolution from service name to actual address
- Real-time awareness of service instance changes
- Flexible configuration of load balancing strategies

### 3. Load Balancing Implementation

Load balancing functionality is implemented in `resolver.go`:

```go
func (r *discoveryResolver) updateState(services []g.Service) {
    addresses := make([]resolver.Address, 0, len(services))
    for _, svc := range services {
        addresses = append(addresses, resolver.Address{
            Addr:       fmt.Sprintf("%s:%d", svc.GetIP(), svc.GetPort()),
            ServerName: svc.GetName(),
            Attributes: attributes.New("weight", svc.GetWeight()),
        })
    }
    // ...update state
}
```

This code converts the service list obtained from the registration center into gRPC address format, and supports:
- Multiple load balancing strategies (like round-robin, weighted round-robin, etc.)
- Automatic removal of unhealthy instances
- Dynamic updates when service list changes

### 4. Highly Extensible Design

Gone framework adopts interface abstraction and dependency injection design principles, making the entire service registration and discovery mechanism highly extensible:
- Supports multiple registration center implementations (Nacos, Consul, Etcd, etc.)
- Customizable load balancing strategies
- Rich service metadata extension capabilities

```

Detailed documentation: [goner/etcd](https://github.com/gone-io/goner/blob/main/etcd/README_CN.md)

## Creating Custom Service Registration and Discovery Components

If existing components don't meet your needs, Gone framework supports developing custom service registration and discovery components. Here are the steps:

### 1. Implement Core Interfaces

First, implement the `g.ServiceRegistry` and `g.ServiceDiscovery` interfaces:

```go
package custom
import (
    "github.com/gone-io/goner/g"
)

type CustomerRegistry struct {
    gone.Flag
    // ...custom fields
}

// Register registers service instance
func (r *CustomerRegistry) Register(instance g.Service) error {
    // Implement service registration logic
}

// Deregister deregisters service instance
func (r *CustomerRegistry) Deregister(instance g.Service) error {
    // Implement service deregistration logic
}

// GetInstances gets list of service instances
func (r *CustomerRegistry) GetInstances(serviceName string) ([]Service, error) {
    // Implement logic to get service instance list
}

// Watch monitors service instance changes
func (r *CustomerRegistry) Watch(serviceName string) (ch <-chan []Service, stop func() error, err error) {
    // Implement service change monitoring logic
}

// Ensure implementation of required interfaces
var _ g.ServiceRegistry = (*CustomerRegistry)(nil)
var _ g.ServiceDiscovery = (*CustomerRegistry)(nil)
```

### 2. Define Load Function

Create a component load function for easy use in applications:

```go
func RegistryLoad(loader gone.Loader) error {
    return gone.OnceLoad(func(loader gone.Loader) error {
        // Load related dependencies
        return loader.Load(&CustomerRegistry{}) // Load custom component
    })(loader)
}
```

Now you can load your custom component just like using built-in components!

## HTTP Service Registration and Discovery

Gone framework not only supports registration and discovery of gRPC services but also has good support for HTTP services. We have already implemented related functionality in **goner/gin** and **goner/urllib**, just load the corresponding service registration and discovery component.

This means that regardless of which communication protocol you choose, Gone framework can provide you with a consistent service governance experience.

## Summary and Future Outlook

Service registration and discovery is key infrastructure in microservice architecture, solving core issues like dynamic communication between services, load balancing, and high availability. Through elegant design and rich component ecosystem, Gone framework provides Go developers with a one-stop service governance solution.
