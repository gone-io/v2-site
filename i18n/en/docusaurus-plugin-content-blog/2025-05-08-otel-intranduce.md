# OpenTelemetry Introduction

## 1. Overview
### What is OpenTelemetry
OpenTelemetry is an observability framework and toolkit designed to create and manage telemetry data such as traces, metrics, and logs. OpenTelemetry is vendor and tool agnostic, meaning it can be used with various observability backends, including open-source tools like Jaeger and Prometheus, as well as commercial solutions. OpenTelemetry is a Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) project.

> The above is OpenTelemetry's official introduction, in plain terms:
> OpenTelemetry is like your application's "health check center," automatically collecting various metrics (heartbeat, blood pressure), tracing request paths (medical process), recording logs (medical records), and sending data in a unified format to various monitoring systems (Prometheus, Jaeger, etc.). Before the OpenTelemetry project, these functions were developed by various vendors independently. Now OpenTelemetry integrates all these functions, making it easier for developers to use. As an industry standard, OpenTelemetry is supported by [over 40 observability vendors](https://opentelemetry.io/ecosystem/vendors/), integrated into many [libraries, services, and applications](https://opentelemetry.io/ecosystem/integrations), and adopted by [numerous end users](https://opentelemetry.io/ecosystem/adopters).

## 2. Core Concepts
### Tracing
Tracing records the path of requests flowing through distributed systems, visualizing service call relationships. Each trace consists of multiple spans, with each span representing a unit of work, including operation name, timestamp, duration, and tags.

**Working Principle**:
1. Create spans at code key points through automatic or manual instrumentation
2. Context propagation mechanism passes TraceID and SpanID between services
3. Sampling strategy determines which traces to record
4. Data export to backend systems for analysis and display

**Application Scenarios**:
- Performance bottleneck analysis
- Distributed transaction tracing
- Error propagation path location

### Metrics
Metrics are numerical measurements of system running state, reflecting system health and performance. OpenTelemetry supports three types of metrics:
1. **Counter**: Monotonically increasing value, like request count
2. **Gauge**: Instantaneous value, like CPU usage
3. **Histogram**: Distribution statistics of values, like response time

**Working Principle**:
- Create metrics and record measurements through Meter
- Support pre-aggregation to reduce data transmission volume
- Configurable export frequency and aggregation methods

**Application Scenarios**:
- System resource monitoring
- Business metrics statistics
- Capacity planning

### Logs
Logs record discrete events during system runtime, providing detailed context information. OpenTelemetry unifies log format and supports structured logging.

**Working Principle**:
1. Log collector receives application logs
2. Log processor performs parsing, filtering, and enhancement
3. Log exporter sends data to backend
4. Can be correlated with traces and metrics for analysis

**Application Scenarios**:
- Error troubleshooting
- Audit tracking
- Behavior analysis

### Baggage
Baggage is key-value pair data transmitted in distributed systems, used to pass business context information across services.

**Working Principle**:
1. Set baggage items at request entry
2. Baggage automatically propagates with request context
3. Services can read baggage content
4. Does not affect core observability data flow

**Application Scenarios**:
- Pass business information like user ID, request source
- A/B testing group markers
- Cross-service debugging information transmission

> About the relationship between Tracing, Metrics, and Logging:
> ![](/img/20250508-otel-intranduce-02.png)
> The three are interconnected, jointly providing complete system observability capabilities. Tracing provides call chain perspective, metrics provide system state overview, and logs provide detailed context. Through unified identifiers (like TraceID), seamless navigation between the three types of data is possible.

## 3. Main Components
### API Layer
Imagine the API layer like buttons and switches on your home appliances—you just need to know which to press, not how the circuits work inside. OpenTelemetry's API layer is just like that, defining simple and clear interfaces that let your application easily "press buttons" to record observability data.

**Why the API Layer is Brilliant**:
- Like a universal remote, one API controls all observability types
- "Write once, run anywhere"—not bound to specific backend implementations
- Light as a feather, minimal impact on application performance
- Stable as a rock, API upgrades won't break your code

**Look at this Simple Code**:
```java
// Tracing API Example - Record start and end of an operation
Tracer tracer = GlobalOpenTelemetry.getTracer("Shopping Cart Service");
Span span = tracer.spanBuilder("Checkout Operation").startSpan();
try (Scope scope = span.makeCurrent()) {
    // Here's your business operation, like processing orders
    span.setAttribute("Order Amount", 199.99);  // Add useful context information
} finally {
    span.end();  // Don't forget to "clock out"!
}

// Metrics API Example - Recording business metrics easier than pen and paper
Meter meter = GlobalOpenTelemetry.getMeter("Payment Service");
LongCounter counter = meter.counterBuilder("Processed Orders").build();
counter.add(1);  // Another order done!
```

### SDK Layer
The SDK layer is OpenTelemetry's engine room, implementing interfaces defined by the API layer and providing actual data processing mechanisms. Like the internal processing chip of an advanced camera, the SDK layer is responsible for converting raw observability data into meaningful information and ensuring it can be correctly transmitted to target systems.

**SDK Layer's Key Functions**:
- Transforms API's abstract concepts into concrete implementations
- Provides flexible sampling strategies, helping you balance between data volume and detail level
- Builds efficient processing pipeline, ensuring observability doesn't impact application performance
- Manages resource attributes, adding environmental context to telemetry data
- Establishes connection bridges with various backend systems

**Configuration Example**:
```java
// SDK Configuration - Tell OpenTelemetry how to process and send data
SdkTracerProvider tracerProvider = SdkTracerProvider.builder()
    // Batch process trace data, reduce network overhead
    .addSpanProcessor(BatchSpanProcessor.builder(OtlpGrpcSpanExporter.builder().build()).build())
    // Add service name to all traces for backend identification
    .setResource(Resource.getDefault().merge(Resource.create(Attributes.of(
        ResourceAttributes.SERVICE_NAME, "Order Management Service"))))
    .build();

// Create complete OpenTelemetry instance
OpenTelemetrySdk openTelemetry = OpenTelemetrySdk.builder()
    .setTracerProvider(tracerProvider)
    .build();
```

### Collector
Collector is OpenTelemetry's central hub, specialized in collecting, transforming, and distributing observability data. It's like a traffic control center, receiving data signals from various services, processing them as needed, and efficiently delivering them to their destinations.

**Collector's Architecture Layers**:
1. **Receivers**: Like multi-functional interface adapters, receiving data from various sources
2. **Processors**: Like data alchemists, filtering, transforming, and enriching raw data
3. **Exporters**: Like professional couriers, accurately delivering data to various monitoring systems
4. **Extensions**: Like plugin system, providing auxiliary functions such as health checks

![](/img/20250508-otel-intranduce-03.png)

**Why Collector is Worth Having**:
- Centralized telemetry data processing, application servers can focus on business logic
- Unified data pipeline, one configuration for distribution to multiple backend systems
- Built-in efficient buffering and retry mechanisms, ensuring no data loss
- Flexible deployment, can act as lightweight sidecar or powerful central gateway

**Configuration Example**:
```yaml
# Collector Configuration - Declare how to receive, process, and send data
receivers:
  otlp:  # Receive OpenTelemetry format data
    protocols:
      grpc:  # Via gRPC protocol
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317
      http:  # Also supports HTTP protocol
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318

processors:
  batch:  # Batch processing to reduce network overhead
    timeout: 1s
    send_batch_size: 1024

exporters:
  prometheus:  # Export metrics in Prometheus format
    endpoint: 0.0.0.0:8889
  jaeger:  # Send trace data to Jaeger
    endpoint: jaeger:14250
    tls:
      insecure: true

service:  # Define data processing pipeline
  pipelines:
    traces:  # Trace data pipeline
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [jaeger]
    metrics:  # Metrics data pipeline
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [prometheus]
```

### Exporters
Exporters are OpenTelemetry's diplomats, responsible for translating collected observability data into languages that various backend systems can understand. Like excellent translators, exporters ensure your valuable data can flow seamlessly into various monitoring tools, regardless of what "dialect" they "speak".

#### OTLP (OpenTelemetry Protocol)
OTLP (OpenTelemetry Protocol) is OpenTelemetry's officially recommended telemetry data transport protocol. It's designed to be efficient, universal, and easily extensible, supporting unified transport of the three major observability signals: traces, metrics, and logs. OTLP typically communicates via gRPC or HTTP and serves as a bridge between OpenTelemetry Collector and various backend systems.

**OTLP Advantages:**
- **Uniformity**: Simultaneously supports traces, metrics, and logs, simplifying data pipeline configuration
- **Efficiency**: Uses binary protocol (gRPC), superior transport performance, supports batch sending and compression
- **Ecosystem Compatibility**: As OpenTelemetry's native protocol, widely supported by community and major backends
- **Flexibility**: Can flexibly route to Prometheus, Jaeger, Elasticsearch, etc. through Collector

**Relationship with Other Exporters:**
- Prometheus exporter mainly used for pull-based metrics collection, suitable for Prometheus ecosystem
- Jaeger exporter focuses on distributed trace data push, suitable for trace analysis
- OTLP exporter is a general solution, can both push to Collector and directly connect to OTLP-supporting backends, implementing one protocol for all observability signals

**OTLP Exporter Configuration Example:**
```yaml
exporters:
  otlp:
    endpoint: "collector:4317"  # gRPC port
    tls:
      insecure: true

service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

**Implementation Example**:
```java
// Configure multiple exporters in Java to send to different backends at once
SdkMeterProvider meterProvider = SdkMeterProvider.builder()
    // Send to Prometheus
    .registerMetricReader(PeriodicMetricReader.builder(
        PrometheusHttpServer.builder().setPort(9464).build())
        .build())
    // Also send to OTLP endpoint
    .registerMetricReader(PeriodicMetricReader.builder(
        OtlpGrpcMetricExporter.builder()
            .setEndpoint("http://collector:4317")
            .build())
        .build())
    .build();
```

## 4. Integration Methods
### Language Support (SDK)
OpenTelemetry is like a multilingual expert, able to "converse" fluently in multiple programming languages. It provides native SDK implementations for major mainstream programming languages, ensuring developers can easily access the observability system regardless of their technology stack.

**Language SDK Family**:
- **Java**: Mature and stable, with auto-instrumentation capabilities, especially suitable for enterprise applications
- **Go**: Lightweight and efficient, perfect fit with cloud-native ecosystem, suitable for microservice architecture
- **Python**: Simple and easy to use, seamlessly integrates with data science tools
- **JavaScript/Node.js**: One SDK spans front and back end, providing full-chain observability from browser to server
- **Other Languages**: .NET, Ruby, Rust, C++, PHP, etc., each with its own strengths, covering all needs

Each language SDK follows unified specifications while fully respecting each language's characteristics and best practices. It's like different arrangements of the same song—core melody consistent but style adapted to different occasions.

**Cross-language Tracing Example**:
In Java service:
```java
Tracer tracer = GlobalOpenTelemetry.getTracer("order-service");
Span orderSpan = tracer.spanBuilder("process-order").startSpan();
try (Scope scope = orderSpan.makeCurrent()) {
    // Process order and call inventory service
    orderSpan.setAttribute("order.id", orderId);
    callInventoryService(orderId);  // Call Go language implemented service
} finally {
    orderSpan.end();
}
```

In Go service:
```go
// Context automatically passes TraceID, no manual handling needed
func CheckInventory(ctx context.Context, orderID string) {
    ctx, span := tracer.Start(ctx, "check-inventory")
    defer span.End()

    span.SetAttributes(attribute.String("order.id", orderID))
    // Check inventory logic
}
```

### Automatic and Manual Instrumentation
Instrumentation is like embedding precise detection points in your program, making your code "observable." OpenTelemetry provides two instrumentation methods, like a chef choosing between an automatic bread machine or manual kneading—both methods have their advantages, choose based on needs.

**Automatic Instrumentation**:
Like putting on a "smart coat" for your application, gaining observability capabilities without code changes. This "zero-intrusion" solution is especially suitable for quick starts or legacy systems that are inconvenient to modify.

```bash
# Java automatic instrumentation example - just add one agent
java -javaagent:opentelemetry-javaagent.jar \
     -Dotel.service.name=Order Service \
     -Dotel.traces.exporter=otlp \
     -Dotel.metrics.exporter=otlp \
     -Dotel.exporter.otlp.endpoint=http://collector:4317 \
     -jar myapp.jar
```

Automatic instrumentation adds trace points for common frameworks and libraries (like Spring, JDBC, Redis, etc.), letting you easily obtain basic observability capabilities.

**Manual Instrumentation**:
Like a chef's precise knife work, manual instrumentation lets you add precise observation points at key business logic points and attach business context.

```go
func ProcessPayment(ctx context.Context, paymentID string, amount float64) error {
    // Create payment processing trace
    ctx, span := tracer.Start(ctx, "Process Payment", 
        trace.WithAttributes(
            attribute.String("payment.id", paymentID),
            attribute.Float64("payment.amount", amount),
            attribute.String("payment.currency", "CNY"),
        ))
    defer span.End()

    // Business logic...
    if err := validatePayment(ctx, paymentID, amount); err != nil {
        // Record error information
        span.SetStatus(codes.Error, "Payment validation failed")
        span.RecordError(err)
        return err
    }

    // Record processing result
    span.SetAttributes(attribute.Bool("payment.success", true))
    return nil
}
```

**Golden Partnership**:
In practice, the best solution is often combining both instrumentation methods:
- Use automatic instrumentation to cover infrastructure and framework code
- Use manual instrumentation to add rich context for key business processes

This way you can enjoy both the convenience of automatic instrumentation and the precise control of manual instrumentation, like the perfect combination of automatic and manual driving.

### Common Framework Integration
OpenTelemetry is like a universal interface adapter, seamlessly connecting with various popular development frameworks. It provides "plug and play" integration solutions, allowing developers to easily obtain observability capabilities within familiar technology stacks.

**Web Framework Adaptation**:
- **Spring Boot/Spring MVC**: Intelligently traces request processing flow, controller calls and view rendering, providing complete view for Java developers
- **Express/Koa(Node.js)**: Elegantly captures HTTP request lifecycle through middleware mechanism, seamlessly integrating into Node.js ecosystem
- **Flask/Django(Python)**: Cleverly traces request routing, template rendering and ORM operations, Python developers' observability tool
- **ASP.NET Core**: Deep integration with request processing pipeline, providing fine-grained tracing for .NET applications

**Data Access Layer Integration**:
- **JDBC/JPA**: Precisely records SQL query execution, including preparation, parameter binding and result handling
- **MongoDB**: Monitors document operations, traces query building and execution process
- **Redis**: Captures command execution details, monitors connection pool status and operation latency
- **Elasticsearch**: Records index and search operations, analyzes query performance bottlenecks

**Message Middleware Integration**:
- **Kafka**: Traces message production and consumption process, monitors partition and consumer group status
- **RabbitMQ**: Records message publishing and subscription events, analyzes queue throughput capacity
- **ActiveMQ/JMS**: Traces message processing flow, monitors queue depth and message latency

**Remote Call Integration**:
- **gRPC**: Two-way tracing of client and server calls, monitors status code distribution and latency
- **RESTful Client**: Records complete HTTP request lifecycle, analyzes call reliability
- **GraphQL**: Captures query parsing and execution process, optimizes field access efficiency

Most of these integrations can be activated with simple configuration, like a race car equipped with advanced sensors, automatically collecting various performance metrics, letting you thoroughly understand application running state. For special needs, you can still add more custom observation points through manual instrumentation, like a race car driver fine-tuning settings based on track conditions.

## 5. Practical Application
### Microservice Monitoring
In microservice architecture, the application system is like a large symphony orchestra—each service is an independent instrument, needing perfect coordination to play beautiful music. OpenTelemetry is the conductor of this orchestra, letting you see clearly how each instrument is performing, ensuring overall coordination.

**Core Value**:
- **Global View**: Like a conductor's overall perspective, can see how requests flow between services, clarifying complex call relationships
- **Dependency Mapping**: Automatically draws service map, revealing which services depend on each other, which paths are most critical
- **Performance Insight**: Precisely measures inter-service communication latency, identifies which "musician" is slow, which "melody" executes poorly
- **Anomaly Warning**: Real-time monitors error rates and anomaly patterns, discovering small problems before they become big crises
- **Capacity Planning**: Collects service throughput metrics, helping decide when to scale, when to optimize

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Configure unique service name and version identifier for each microservice, like assigning fixed seats to each musician
- Ensure correct context propagation at service boundaries, maintaining trace continuity, like relay baton can't break
- Deploy resource detectors to automatically collect environment information (Kubernetes, cloud providers), understand "performance venue"
- Add custom attributes for business-critical processes, marking "solo" and "ensemble" parts
- Centrally deploy Collector for data aggregation and preprocessing, reducing service burden

The biggest challenge in microservice monitoring is understanding system overall behavior—OpenTelemetry helps you understand the entire system's operation like reading transparent sheet music by correlating scattered observability data.
